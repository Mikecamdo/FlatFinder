# FlatFinder
Final Project for CS 3345 Graphical User Interfaces

As part of a 5 person team, I helped develop the frontend for our website FlatFinder. FlatFinder allows landlords to post available properties, and tenants can search through and apply to live in these properties. Features include filtering properties (by name, price, etc.), leaving comments/reviews on properties, and creation of a custom profile (including attributes like dog-friendly, smoker, etc.).
